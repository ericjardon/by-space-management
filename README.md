## Space Management App
This project was created for the BlueYonder Challenge in HackMty 2020, within a 24-hour time limit.

This was the first time in a Hackathon competition for our 4-person team.

The basic idea is to have a flexible interface that allows to design the layout for a restaurant (or any other type of business space) and to calculate the spaces available for use using two criteria:
- Safe Distance (1.5 meters in this version)
- Restricions on % Capacity with respect to total number of tables (or lots to be allocated).

### The technologies used:
- React
- Styled Components
- Node.js

To run the App, type in on the terminal 'npm start'.
